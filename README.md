# Application of NerfMM to fNIRS

This project aims to cluster (Green) bright dots on top of a quarter cycle video. 

The project report is in the pdf file located inside this directory.

## Installation

Clone the project - 

`git clone https://github.com/fortnite/vore.git`

Install the dependencies - Same as nerfmm. Conda can do this for you.

## Usage

This adds two files to the improved-nerfmm implementation - newrender.py is meant to cluster the dots, and uses the same dir arguments as the regular python files. Only 1 parameter is typically required.
